# Froget

## Inspiration
As CST students balancing tough deadlines, coursework, and life, we often lose track of our good habits and succumb to not-so-great ones. It's easy to dwell on the negatives in our busy lives, overlooking the positives. That's why we've decided to create a simple habit and mood tracker. Our goal is to help students look back on the good and bad days, understand what makes a day go well, and learn from the not-so-good ones. Our goal is to bring balance and mindfulness back into our hectic lives, guiding us to foster better habits and maintain our emotional well-being.

## What it does
Our app allows users to:
- Record their habits, goals, and mood along with detailed information (optional)
- Display recorded information dynamically so they can look at it in the future
- Provide a calendar for users to plan habits and goals
- Provide an email contact form

## How we built it
- **Frontend**: React + Typescript + JavaScript
- **Backend**: Spring (Java + Rest API)
- **Database**: MySQL

## Challenges we ran into
- Setting up backend-frontend connection
- Learning new unfamiliar libraries and frameworks
- Finishing core features with a very tight timeline

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Successfully connected frontend & backend
- Read and write data between the user interface and database
- Working together as a team
- Making new friends and collaborating with other passionate developers

## What we learned
- How to work effectively and efficiently in a team
- Becoming more familiar with new tools and libraries (React, Spring)
- Communication between team members
- Managing a Github repository among 6 team members
- Working under pressure and tight timelines

## What's next for Froget
With more time, we hope to:
- Add dynamic mood icons to the calendar, showcasing the mood for each calendar date
- Create a user profile with graphs and data to visualize habits and mood trends
- Implement a reward system that promotes continuous habit & goal setting
